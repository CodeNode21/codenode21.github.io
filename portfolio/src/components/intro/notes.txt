// Intro examples
   Hi, Iâ€™m Matt. Nice to meet you.
Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.

    I'm a multi-talented human. Most of my time I design and build digital products. You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 9 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, manager, advisor, entrepreneur, front-end developer, music enthusiast, traveler, photographer and more.
